# Handwritten Digits Classifier

Project I made to classify handwritten digits. It is all made in java without any import except standard java library.
It is a neural network that uses the [MNist dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) as data.
The current setup, such as network layout and hyper parameters, makes the network reach about 94% accuracy after a few epochs.
